What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializng a repository associates a .git directory with the current directory. 
From that point on, git can be used for version control in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area maps the files that we want to add from the working directory to the repository
on the next commit.
